### Adding Cost Allocation Tags
{{% notice tip %}}
Cost Allocation tags can be added to any views. We recommend adding while creating the dashboard to eliminate rework. 
{{% /notice %}}

{{%expand "Click here - to add your cost allocation tags" %}}
To add your tags locate the the "line_item_usage_account_id" "linked_account_id" in the query you are using and add it after make sure to add a comma between each attribute and then add a group by field for any tags added (i.e. if you add one cost allocation tag you would add **,13** to group by in the bottom of your query)

- Example: Add your project tag by first locating the tag in your CUR attributes for project it will show up as **resource_tags_user_projects**. You will then find the **,"line_item_usage_account_id" "linked_account_id"** line in your query and add **, resource_tags_user_projects** then add **,13** in at the bottom of your query in the group by section.

{{% /expand%}}
- Confirm the view is working, run the following Athena query and substitute (database) for your CUR database and you should receive 10 rows of data:

        select * from (database).s3_view
        limit 10
